In CSS, "flex-direction" is a property that controls the primary layout direction of items within a flex container, defining whether the items are arranged horizontally (row) or vertically (column), and whether they should be ordered in the default or reversed direction (e.g., "row-reverse" for left-to-right reversed) within that container; essentially, it sets the main axis along which flex items are placed. 
Key points about flex-direction:
Default value: "row" - items are arranged horizontally from left to right.
Possible values:
row: Horizontal layout (left to right)
row-reverse: Horizontal layout (right to left)
column: Vertical layout (top to bottom)
column-reverse: Vertical layout (bottom to top) 
Example usage:
Code

.flex-container {

  display: flex;

  flex-direction: column; /* Arrange items vertically */ 

}

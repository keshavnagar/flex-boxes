axes : 

so there are two axes in flex box : 

1. main axis
2. cross axis 

main axis : left to right 
cross axis : top to bottom

also show in 5 image 

the starting point of main axis known as main start 
and ending point of main axis known as main ending

and the length between main start and main end point is known as main size 

means we can say that the main axis flow from main start to main end and take main size length

similarly in cross axis

the starting point of cross axis known as cross start
and ending point of cross axis known as cross end 

and the length between cross start and cross end point is known as cross size 

means we can say that the cross axis flow from cross start to cross end and take cross size length
